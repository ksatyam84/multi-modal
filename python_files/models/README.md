This folder contains the models we have developed given our training data with a specific naming convention to understand at a glance what setting or changes were made between different models.

NAMING CONVENTION: modelName_V#_Sample_V#_Transform_nameV#.pth
    
    modelName_V#: ex. ResNet18_V1

    Sample_V#: This is the data sampling/datasets we are using for the training for each particular model, ex. Sample_V1...V2,V3...Vn

    Transform_nameV#: ex. Transform_baseV0 or Transform_baseV0

Please reach out to Kris Kodweis if you have any questions about how to name models or what settings should be used.
